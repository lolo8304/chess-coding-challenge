# chess-coding-challenge

Based on the recording challenge https://codingchallenges.fyi of John Cricket I have implemented a chess engine, including a little AI. 

# Build

I have fully built the engine with JavaScript directly executively the browser using P5.js

# Run

just open index.html

# Play online

https://chess-coding-challenge.vercel.app

# Limitations

- remove generator doesn't hundred percent fit needed move numbers based on the FEN library
- performance of the move generator is quite bad. Optimizations on the way.

# Credits 

- to John Cricket for the awesome challenge https://codingchallenges.fyi 
- to Sebastian Lague for the great video material about chess engines and how to build a real one. https://youtu.be/U4ogK0MIzqk?si=itPHMxA0jwsLFYsc
